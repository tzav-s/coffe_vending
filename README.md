# coffe_vending

A coffee vending machine accepts only ONE € 5 banknote at a time and gives the
change on 10, 20 & 50 cent coins as well as 1 and 2 euro coins. Every coffee costs
70 minutes. Write a program that asks for the number of coffees (int) and displays the
change (in coins) (int) that must be given from the € 5 banknote. In the event that
not enough money displays the appropriate message. (Money is calculated in euro cents).
